# Module-10-Assignment - Crypto Clustering

#### by Alex Melino

#

### Overview

This assignment deals with unsupervised machine learning, in particular k-means clustering and principal component analysis (PCA). The data used (found in the Resources folder, crypto_market_data.csv) is of cryptocurrency price change data.

#

### Assignment 

The crypto_investments.ipynb file contains the python code used for the assignment. In this file, the data is imported, prepared and then put through a series of analsis using k-means, data clustering, and PCA. The results are visualized and compared.

Some of the libraries and dependencies used in this assignment are pandas, hvplot, and sklearn.

#

### Results

The end results of the analysis highlight the advantages of using principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the number if dimensions of the data down to something more manageable and accurate for the task of k-means clustering. The final visualizations show an easier-to-interpret elbow curve as well as a more clearly defined cluster scatter plot.
